#Decision tree used for regression and classification
#Can be used for both type of analysis

###REGRESSION TREE###
#Regions, subsetting space into different regions
#Powerpoint Notes
#Two Variables
#X1 = t1  (Root note = X1)
#Split down middle
#X1 < t1 go left
#X1 > t1 go right

#Supervised Learning (nonparametric)
#understand parametric vs nonparametric

#numerical variables = binary model 
#Categorical variables = different

#partitions is based on lowest MSE
#overfit = errors will be high

#tree pruning ??
#How do we predict the values of Y?
#splitting criteria is based on minimizing the MSE

###Classification Tree###
#based on probability

#Pros and Cons of Decision Trees

#Random Forest
